    <!-- 

    It is possible to override the default initialisation behaviour of
    MartExplorer by creating a ".martj_adaptor.xml" file in your home
    directory.

    This file contains example entries that shows how to connect to
    specific databases and load specific dataset view files. It makes
    connections to 2 databases and loads one dataset view file.

    If you don't want default connections made at start up and no view
    files to be loaded then see the file
    "example_no_adaptors.martj_adaptors.xml".  

    Note that MartExplorer remembers any datasources and files that
    you loaded before so you will need to remove these via "Settings |
    Adaptors | Delete All".

    to the correct real driver. See docs/developer.txt for more
    information. -->
