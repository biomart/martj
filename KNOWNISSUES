Known Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This system has been developed and tested predominantly in Linux, Windows 2000
  and Windows NT

- It does not have all of the mart datasets specified, but the ones that 
are specified are relatively complete compared to the existing web MartView system 
written in Perl.  

- MartExplorer does not perform optimally when handling multiple dataset configurations.
We are actively developing solutions to this issue.

- The MartShell history/command completion system relies on JNI interaction with the GNU Readline
(*NIX), or GetLine (Windows) c libraries.  For this reason, shared object files must
be compiled for each platform that the system is to be run on, and placed in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or windows equivalent).  Without this, MartShell works fine, but
without command completion or history (although Windows users with doskey will get crude 
history functionality).  The list and describe commands can be used to replace
the completion system.
Currently, only linux and tru64 are supported in the distribution.  Users wishing to 
make an immediate contribution to the project could obtain the Java-Readline source 
from http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/ and follow the instructions
to compile on their favorite unsupported platforms.  Once the 
test works, the resulting .so file can be sent to us along with an
example bin/martshell.sh or bin/martshell.bat file that makes
MartShell completion and history work.
Contributors would be duly cited in the README of future distributions.
