Notes for MartExplorer developers
=================================

Ant (Build tool)
----------------

The build program used is called ant. This is used for compiling code,
javadoc documentation, ant creating MartExplorer distribution
files. Running "ant -projecthelp" in the same directory as build.xml
(the build file) will produce a list of currently supported "targets"
or actions. To run one these just type "ant TARGET" e.g. "ant
compile", "ant clean", "ant api", "ant dist" ant "ant test". 

If you don't have ant then you need to install it. You can download it
from http://ant.apache.org.

Ant needs some extra jars to handle our build file. You can include
them in your classpath or more simply copy them to $ANT_HOME/lib or
your JVMs /ext directory. The extra jars are included in ./lib:

  - optional.jar
  - junit.jar
  - xalan.jar
