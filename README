README for MartExplorer
=======================

MartExplorer provides access to Mart databases via several means:

- An application with a graphical user interface.

- A command line tool.

- A java library for programmers.



REQUIREMENTS
------------

You must have java installed on your computer and the JVM ("java"
program) should be included in your path.

You must have network access to the database(s) you want to retrieve
data from.



RUNNING THE GRAPHICAL APPLICATION
---------------------------------

All users can start the application from a shell like this:

   java -jar mart-explorer-0.01/lib/mart-explorer.jar

Un*x users can also run the application by running the script
martexplorer.sh. Do this by either:

a) prompt>sh bin/martgui.sh

b) prompt>chmod +x bin/martgui.sh (make it executable, only have to do this once).
   prompt>bin/martgui.sh 

Windows users might be able to run the program by 'clicking' on the file
./lib/mart-explorer.jar.



RUNNING THE COMMAND LINE TOOL
-----------------------------

All users can start the application from a shell like this so long as
they have the classpath set up to include ./lib/*.jar:

   java org.ensembl.mart.explorer.MartExplorerTool

Un*x users can also run the tool by running the script
martcl.sh. Do this by either:

a) prompt>sh bin/martcl.sh

b) prompt>chmod +x bin/martcl.sh (make it executable, only have to do this once).
   prompt>bin/martcl.sh 




USING THE LIBRARY
-----------------

Include these jars in your classpath:
  - martexplorer.jar
  - log4j-1.2.6.jar
  - java-getopt-1.0.9.jar
  - mysql-connector-java-2.0.14-bin.jar (or some other mysql jdbc driver)
