    <!-- 

    It is possible to override the default initialisation behaviour of
    MartExplorer by creating a ".martj_adaptor.xml" file in your home
    directory.

    By copying this file to your home directory as
    ".martj_adaptors.xml" you will prevent the default initialisation
    file from being used.

    Note that MartExplorer remembers any datasources and files that
    you loaded before so you will need to remove these via "Settings |
    Adaptors | Delete All".
