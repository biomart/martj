<p>This package contains dummy implementations of the Apple MRJ MacOSX 
integration package. When run on a non-Mac it has no effect. When run on
an actual Mac, the system implementation takes precedence and this
dummy implementation is ignored. This allows BioMart to supply one
codebase for everyone which dynamically adapts itself to the platform the user
chooses to run it on.</p>
