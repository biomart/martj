<p>This package contains the generic data structures required for
BioMart apps to represent source database schemas.</p>
<p>The central parts of the model are {@link Schema} objects which
provide {@link Table}s to work with. The {@link Table}s each have a
number of {@link Column}s, {@link Key}s, and can store {@link Relation}s
between {@link PrimaryKey}s or {@link ForeignKey}s.</p>
<p>{@link Schema}s do the work of creating all the {@link Table}s
and related objects by querying a database or other data source. These
{@link Schema}s know exactly how their data source works.</p>
<p>If the {@link Schema} gets the {@link Key}s or {@link Relation}s
wrong, the user can edit them.</p>
