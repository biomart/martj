We are pleased to announce the release of the next development snapshot
of martj - the java based data access tools and a design workbench
for mart databases.
                                                                                                                             
This release consists of:
                                                                                                                             
1. MartEditor - Configuration Editor (beta)
2. MartShell -  Interactive Shell    (beta)
3. MartExplorer - GUI         (development)
                                                                                                                             
The main feature of the current snapshot is the addition of the almost
fully featured mart configuration system, which allows to automatically
create 'de novo' dataset configurations, modify existing configurations
and automatically include user added tables to existing mart databases.
                                                                                                                             
As of this release all mart databases comply with a new table naming
convention, which supports automated configuration
