Release Notes: 
This distribution is a development snapshot release aimed to provide the 'feel' for the new
functionality and interfaces offered by the BioMart system. The interfaces are still incomplete and are not intended
to be used for 'serious' data retrieval. (It is recommended that BioMart web interface is to be used for that). In
addition, there are number of known issues, which are being currently resolved in the preparation for the fully stable,
'production quality' alpha version, which is going to be released in the near future.
