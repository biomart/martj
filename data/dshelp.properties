sequence=Brief Description - requests that a query returns a sequence (flanking sequences may also be included). \
	\n\nUsage - using ... get sequence <l+>name_of_sequence<+r> where ... \
        \n\nDetailed Description - leaving out the <l+> and <+r> options returns just the sequence. \
	  \n                       Can specify the size of the flanking sequences: \
          \n                       - l denotes the amount of upstream (left) flanking sequence to include in the sequence, \
          \n                       - r denotes the amount of downstream (right) flanking sequence to include.\
        \n\nExamples - \
        \n\tsequence 100+gene_exons+100\tgets all exons on a given gene, with 100 bp up- and down-stream flanking added to \
	\n\t                                each exon. \
        \n\tsequence transcript_flanks+100\tgets 100 bp of downstream flanking sequence for each transcript. \n\n
