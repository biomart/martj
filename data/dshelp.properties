sequence=usage: sequence <l+>name_of_sequence<+r> \
                \n  request sequences, optionally with flanking sequences \
                \n  (note, some sequences are not flankable). \
                \n    l denotes the amount of upstream (left) flanking sequence to include in the sequence, \
                \n    r denotes the amount of downstream (right) flanking sequence to include.\
                \n\n  examples: \
                \n\n\tsequence 100+gene_exons+100 \
                \n\t  gets all exons on a given gene, with 100 bp upstream flanking \
                \n\t  and downstream sequence added to each exon.\
                \n\n\tsequence transcript_flanks+100 \
                \n\t  gets 100 bp of downstream flanking sequence for each transcript. \n
