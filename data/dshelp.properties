sequence=usage: sequence <l+>name_of_sequence<+r> \
                \nrequest sequences, optionally with flanking sequences (note, some sequences are not flankable). \
                \n\tl denotes the amount of upstream (left) flanking sequence to include in the sequence, \
                \n\tr denotes the amount of downstream (right) flanking sequence to include.\
                \n\nsequence_name must match the name of a sequence available from the system \
                \n(see the javadoc SequenceDescription documentation for more information). \
                \n\nexamples: \
                \n\n\tsequence 100+gene_exons+100 \
                \n\t\tgets all exons on a given gene, with 100 bp upstream flanking and downstream sequence added to each exon.\
                \n\n\tsequence transcript_flanks+100 \
                \n\t\tgets 100 bp of downstream flanking sequence for each transcript. \n

Marker=usage: filter_name = marker_name - Marker filters require a valid marker_name.\n

Band=usage: filter_name = band_name - Band filters require a valid band_name.\n

Encode=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - Encode filters must include a valid location definition set by the Encode group.\n

Qtl=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - QTL filters must include a valid location definition for a QTL.\n

Expression=usage: filter_name = x=y<,x=y>* - Expression filters must include one or more comma separated key=value pairs.\n\tkey must \
           be a valid EVOC category (anatomical_site, development_stage, pathology, cell_type)\n\tvalue must be a valid EVOC term associated with the corresponding EVOC category.\n
