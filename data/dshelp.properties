sequence=usage: sequence <l+>name_of_sequence<+r>  - request sequences, optionally with flanking sequences \
         (note, some sequences are not flankable).\n\tl denotes the amount of upstream (left) flanking sequence to include in the sequence,\n\tr denotes \
         the amount of downstream (right) flanking sequence to include.\n

Marker=usage: filter_name = marker_name - Marker filters require a valid marker_name.\n

Band=usage: filter_name = band_name - Band filters require a valid band_name.\n

Encode=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - Encode filters must include a valid location definition set by the Encode group.\n

Qtl=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - QTL filters must include a valid location definition for a QTL.\n

Expression=usage: filter_name = x=y<,x=y>* - Expression filters must include one or more comma separated key=value pairs.\n\tkey must \
           be a valid EVOC category (anatomical_site, development_stage, pathology, cell_type)\n\tvalue must be a valid EVOC term associated with the corresponding EVOC category.\n
