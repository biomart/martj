sequenceUsage:\n\n  get sequence type; -- returns sequences of type for every gene in the \
                \n  mart. \
              \n\n  get sequence type_U2000 where filt; -- returns sequence of type for \
                \n  each gene, with its upstream sequence extended by 2000bp, satisfying \
                \n  the filter criterion. \
              \n\n  get xref_swissprot_id sequence type_D2000 where filt1, filt2; -- gets \
                \n  sequences of type for meeting the filter criteria, with downstream \
                \n  sequence extended by 2000bp, adding the swissprot display id, either \
                \n  as a field in tabulated output, or in the description of the header \
                \n  in fasta output.\n
sequenceExample:\n  get xref_swissprot_id sequence peptide where disease_genes excluded; \
