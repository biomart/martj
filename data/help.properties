intro=\n  MartShell is an Interactive User Interface to Mart based on MartQuery Language (MQL). \
        INSERT:CommandHistoryHelp \
        INSERT:CommandCompletionHelp \
        \n\n  type 'help' for a list of available commands, or type 'help command' \
          \n  to get help for a particular command. \
        \n\n  The system has a 'describe' command to display datasets, \
          \n  attributes, or filters of the mart being querried \
          \n  (see 'help describe' for further information).\n
MQLintro=\n  Mart Query Language commands are designed to resemble human-readable \
          \n  english sentences (for more information on MQL type 'help MQL').\
          \n  Some example MQL commands: \
        \n\n\tget ensembl_gene_id; \
        \n\t  This requires that a DatasetView, and possibly a Mart \
        \n\t  be set using a previous 'use' command \
        \n\t  (see 'help use' for information), or the -d switch to the Shell. \
        \n\t  It would return all of the ensembl_gene_id entries for the DatasetView \
        \n\t  previously set with the 'use' command or -d switch. \
        \n\n\tusing homo_sapiens_ensembl_genes get ensembl_gene_id where disease_genes only;\
        \n\t  This command would get all ensembl_gene_ids for homo_sapiens_ensembl_genes \
        \n\t  disease genes, temporarily over riding the DatasetView set with a previous \
        \n\t  'use' command' for the duration of the individual query. \
        \n\n  MQL statements can be written entirely on one line, or split across \
          \n  separate lines, with spacing to make the more complex commands easier \
          \n  to read. \
        \n  There can be multiple MQL statements on a single line, separated by \
        \n  semicolons (most useful when passing commands at the commandline \
        \n  using -e).\n
usage=\n  add Mart < key=value<, key=value> <as MartName >>; -- \
      \n  Creates a Mart, with optional connection parameters and reference name. \
      \n  If connection parameters are specified, but no as statement is included, defaults \
      \n  to instanceName@host.  If no connection parameters / name is provided,  and the \
      \n  mode is interactive, the shell querries the user for information to create a Mart, \

                     \n\n  filter_name must match the internal_name for a filter specified in \
                       \n  the MartConfiguration for the mart being querried. \
                       \n  When the filter is part of a filter_set (as specified in the MartConfiguration \
                       \n  System), the filter_name must be further qualified with a filter_set_name \

FilterSet=usage: filter_set_name.filter_name qualifier <value> \
                 \n\n  The filter_name for filters in collections belonging to a FilterSet \

                 \n\t\tspecifies that only snps that are coding_snps in ensembl genes should be returned.\n
FilterList=usage:  filter_name in list \
             \n\nlist requests must be in one of the following formats: \

             \n\t -filter_name in namedProcedureName (see 'help namedProcedures' for details).\

             \n\t\tonly return genes matching the ensembl_gene_ids in the list.\n
use=usage: use DatasetView_name<>MartName> \
           \n\n  This sets the environmental DatasetView, and optionally the Mart, for subsequent querries.  \
             \n This DatasetView can only be over ridden with a 'using' clause in the MQL, or with a subsequent \
             \n  call to 'use'. The Mart can be overridded with the same, or with a set Mart command.\n
namedProcedures=Users can store MQL commands to execute later either with the execute procedure command, or as a list \
                \n filter in another MQL command.  Procedures can be stored with bind variables (using the question mark '?') \
                \n in place of actual strings, and these can be bound at usage to specific values each time the named \
                \n procedure is executed.  To store a namedProcedure, type an entire MQL command as you would to \
                \n execute it, but end it with 'as namedProcedureName'.  To execute this procedure, type \
                \n execute procedure namedProcedureName; \
                \n To use the named Procedure as a list filter in another MQL query, use the namedProcedureName \
                \n as the value to the filter in the other MQL. \
                \n To execute a command with bind variables, either using execute, or in a list filter, \
                \n append the replacement strings, in the order in which they should substitute for \
                \n question marks in the original MQL, separated by commas within perentheses to the namedProcedureName. \
              \n\n examples: \
                \n using ensembl_genes_mus_musculus get human_homologue_ensembl_gene_id as humanMouseHomologs; \
