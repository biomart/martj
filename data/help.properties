setVerbose=usage: setVerbose on|off (on turns logging system output on, off turns it off)\n

exec=usage: exec <n><,><y>  - If History is available, executes the requested line ('exec n'), or series of lines ('exec n,y') and adds them to the \
            history.\n\t\t\tsee 'help history' for information on the n,y system of denoting line numbers.\n

runScript=usage: runScript path_to_your_file_goes_here - runs the querries in a script file in sequence,\nadding the lines to the history \
          if it is available.\n

loadScript=usage: loadScript path_to_your_file_goes_here - If the history system is available, loads the lines from a script \
          \ninto the history without executing them, making them avialble for commandline editing.\n

saveToScript=usage: saveToScript <n><,><y> path_to_recieving_file - If the history system is available,\nstores all lines ('saveToScript path') \
             or a series of lines ('saveToScript n,y path') into a script file.\nsee 'help history' for information on the n,y system of denoting \
             line numbers.\n

history=usage: history <n><,><y> - show all history ('history'), or one or more lines from the history.\nn denotes the number of the first line \
        to include. y denotes the number of the last line to include.\nEither (but not both) can be blank, eg., 'n,' means all lines \
        from n to the end of the history; while ',y' means all lines from the beginning of the history to line y.\n

select=usage:\n\tselect attributelist (comma separated list of attributes.  attributelist can be omitted for sequence requests, otherwise at \
              least one attribute is required)\n\tDOMAINSPECIFIC selectSequenceUsage\n\tfrom requested_dataset_name \
              (datasetname must match one of the datasets available, see 'describe' for details)\n\t< where \

              \n\t< into format_file (see 'help into' for details) >\n\t< limit n (actually adds 'limit n' to the SQL command. \
              This limits the number of focus objects processed, not the number of lines returned) > \
              \n\nThe minimal acceptable query would be 'select att from dataset;'.  \
              \nThe minimal acceptable sequence query would be 'select sequence seqrequest from dataset;'.\nA sequence query with attributes would be \
              'select attlist sequence seqrequest from dataset;'\n\nYou can type the entire command on \
              one line, or you can type the command with lines and spacing to make it more readable.\n

sequence=usage: sequence <l+>name_of_sequence<+r>  - request sequences, optionally with flanking sequences \
         (note, some sequences are not flankable).\n\tl denotes the amount of upstream (left) flanking sequence to include in the sequence,\n\tr denotes \
         the amount of downstream (right) flanking sequence to include.\n

FilterRequest=usage: filter_name qualifier <value> - Filters must be in one of the following formats:\n\t\tfilter_name excluded|exclusive - \

          FilterSet\nmust be further qualified with a filter_set_name separated from the filter_name with a period.\n

list=usage:  filter_name in list - list requests must be in one of the following formats:\n\tfilter_name \
     in url - url must be a valid url pointing to some resource with ids matching the filter_name, one per \
     line\n\tfilter_name in (comma_separated_list of ids matching filter_name). Note, the list must be enclosed \
     in perentheses, but no quoting is required.\n\tfilter_name in (NestedQuery).  See 'help NestedQuery' for details.  Note, the NestedQuery \
     must be enclosed with perentheses.\n

NestedQuery=Nested Query filters must meet the requirements of a full query (see 'help select' for details), along with the following constraints: \
            \n\tThey must only return one attribute, and values returned by that attribute must be applicable to the\n\t\tfilter_name \
            provided in the filter request.\n\tThey cannot include a sequence request, or into request.\n\tCurrently, only \
            one level of nesting is allowed (eg., a NestedQuery cannot include another NestedQuery filter).\n

into=usage: into setOutputFormat - Sets the format, output file, and/or separator to use for the query.\nFor this query only, \
            over rides session settings that are set with the setOutputSettings command, or default settings (see 'help setOutputSettings' \
            for details).\nThe format for setOutputFormat matches the format for the setOutputSettings command, with the additional requirements \
            that the word 'tab' must be used to request\ntab separated fields, and 'space' must be used to request space separated fields.\n

Marker=usage: filter_name = marker_name - Marker filters require a valid marker_name.\n

Band=usage: filter_name = band_name - Band filters require a valid band_name.\n

Encode=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - Encode filters must include a valid location definition set by the Encode group.\n

Qtl=usage: filter_name = chr_number:start_bp:end_bp - QTL filters must include a valid location definition for a QTL.\n

Expression=usage: filter_name = x=y<,x=y>* - Expression filters must include one or more comma separated key=value pairs.\n\tkey must \
           be a valid EVOC category (anatomical_site, development_stage, pathology, cell_type)\n\tvalue must be a valid EVOC term associated with the corresponding EVOC category.\n
